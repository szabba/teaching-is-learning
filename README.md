> [...] In my most recent zine, I explain netstat, netcat, ngrep, tcpdump, wireshark, strace, eBPF, dstat, and perf and a bunch of its subcommands. This is a lot of stuff!! But because it's presented in an adorable tiny zine people are like "oh how interesting and cute!" and don't hesitate to pick it up.
